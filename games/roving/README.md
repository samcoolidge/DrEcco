                <li>The mine placement should not block all paths of the mothership from the base to the destination.

            <br>
            <ul>
                <li> Your objective is to move the mothership from the base to the destination across a minefield as
                    quickly as possible. To aid you in your quest, you have some dispensible rovers to scout and destroy
                    mines.
                </li>
                <li>In each turn you may move the mothership, spawn a rover if you have one available, or move a
                    rover.
                </li>
                <li>To move the mothership or a rover, select it with left click and then left click on a tile that is
                    adjacent to it. Neither the mothership nor the rovers can move diagonally on the field or through
                    other rovers or skip tiles.
