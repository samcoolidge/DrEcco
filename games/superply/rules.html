You have a multiplication table 1 through 9 along the top and 1 through 9 along the left side. Initially, the interior squares are blank. You then get hints. For example, "the product is less than 30" or "the product contains a 7". Many of the product cells correspond to the hint. The issue is which one to choose.
<br/>
There are two players, blue and red.
<br/>
The goal of the blue player is to build a blue path across the grid (from the leftmost column to the rightmost) where a blue path consists of a sequence blue squares such that the first one is in the left column, the last is in the right column and each square touches the next one in the sequence on a side or on a corner. 
<br/>
The goal of the red player is to build a red path from top to bottom.
<br/>
To claim a square, the blue/red player must choose one that satisfies the hint he/she gets and that is not already occupied. 
<br/>
If the player's selection is not valid the turn goes to the other player.
