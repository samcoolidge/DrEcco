# Superply

Superply is a game to help kids learn math or other subject matters. To see how it works, consider the multiplication table. So you have 1 through 9 along the top and 1 through 9 along the left side. Initially, the interior squares are blank. You then get hints. For example, "the product is less than 30" or "the product contains a 7". Many of the product cells correspond to the hint. The issue is which one to choose.

The goal of the blue player is to build a blue path across the grid (from the leftmost column to the rightmost) where a blue path consists of a sequence blue squares such that the first one is in the left column, the last is in the right column and each square touches the next one in the sequence on a side or on a corner. The goal of the red player is to build a red path from top to bottom.

To claim a square, the blue player must choose one that satisfies the hint he/she gets and that is not already occupied. Similarly for the red player.

At any point, the state of the game is the set of squares colored blue and the set colored red.
Play alternates between players.

Nikita Sharma and I are the contributers to this game. This is our final project for heuristic problem solving course at NYU.
